# Remix FSC

An attempt to implement a [full stack component](https://www.epicweb.dev/full-stack-components) in the latest version of remix

The index route imports User, which defines a loader and a non default exported component. However, the user loader never fires.
you can visit localhost:5173/user to see the user json successfully returned.

# To run

`npm install`
`npm  run dev`
